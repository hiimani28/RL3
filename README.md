# RL-Project: GridWorld Simulation with SARSA, Q-Learning, Gradient Monte Carlo, and Semi-Gradient TD(0) Implementation

This project is a simulation of a GridWorld environment implemented using Python and Tkinter. The purpose of the simulation is to demonstrate and compare various reinforcement learning algorithms for policy evaluation and improvement. The GridWorld environment includes special states with predefined transitions and rewards. The agent explores the grid, learns the value function, and updates its policy to maximize the cumulative reward.

## GridWorld Overview

### Features
- GridWorld environment.
- Real-time visualization of the value function and policy.
- Special states with predefined rewards and transitions.
- Implementation of SARSA and Q-Learning algorithms in a 5x5 grid with specific predefined states and rewards.
- Implementation of Gradient Monte Carlo and Semi-Gradient TD(0) algorithms in a 7x7 grid with different specific states and rewards.

## Report
